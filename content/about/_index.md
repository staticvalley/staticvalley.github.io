##### About me 

Hey, I’m Jonathan, and this is my small blog website. I’m currently a fifth-year software engineering student, but find enjoyment in many other fields, especially mathematics, history, politics, and philosophy. The goal of this site is just to be able to have a place to post anything, whether it be WASM experiments, old essays, or just blog posts. Recommendations are always appreciated, either send me a message over one of the accounts on /socials or over my email.

##### How was this site made?
I have created this site using a combination of Hugo's static site generation, alongside my own custom theming. There is also quite a fair bit of bootstrap and jquery within the sites theme. The source is available<a class="navlink rounded m-1" href="https://github.com/staticvalley/staticvalley.github.io"><b>here.</b></a>
