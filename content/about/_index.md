##### About me 

Hey, I’m Jonathan, and this is my small blog website. I’m currently a fifth-year software engineering student, but find enjoyment in many other fields, especially mathematics, history, politics, and philosophy. The goal of this site is just to be able to have a place to post anything, whether it be WASM experiments, old essays, or just blog posts. Recommendations are always appreciated, either send me a message over one of the accounts on /socials or over my email.

##### What does "kairos" mean?
"kairos", from the Greek καιρός, is the idea of the critical moment for action, or in other words the "time to strike". Although a Greek word, the term/concept comes up a lot in many of my interests/readings, from biblical literature to history to rhetoric. Seeing as all of the net is virtually available at any direct moment from a search or a few clicks, I thought kairos served as a pretty fitting name for my small site :)

##### How was this site made?
I have created this site using a combination of Hugo's static site generation, alongside my own custom theming. There is also quite a fair bit of bootstrap and jquery within the sites theme.
